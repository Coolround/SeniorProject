# SeniorProject
This includes all files associated with my senior project completed along with Jared Kempton.

This folder contains all relevant files to the senior project.

There are a few main parts to the project; data acquisition, data analysis, research poster, research presentation, and the research paper.

The data acquisition was done by Jared. We were given an OceanOptics spectrometer and a fiber optic cable. Jare would make the environment as dark as possible to minimize interference. He would then use a program on his phone to display a specific color given RGB values. Next, he would capture the spectra with the spectrometer. Finally, he would prep the data and then send it to me for analysis.

I completed the data analysis. The code is very messy, though I tried very hard to organize it with Google Collab's notebook features.

Both Jared and I put a lot of work into each of the poster, presentation, and paper.

The only thing of note is that the presentation was a 10 minute presentation and there are some general speaker notes in the presentation itself. The paper can be read to get a more in-depth understanding of the project.
